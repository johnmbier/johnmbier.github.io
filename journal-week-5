Week 5

For me, week 5 was a chance to try and review my earlier assignments in an effort to improve them. however, I ended up
focusing on redoing my blog assignment. I still have an issue with my comments in general. I cant figure out why this is
such a sticking point. Both during the original assignment and this retool. I cannot get the comments to show up on the 
show page of the post that they are associated with. It's frustrating because i don't think anyone else had a hard time at all.
I need to ask for help and stop feeling embarrassed that simple things are tripping me up. If i dont start asking for help
Im going to fall more behind.
