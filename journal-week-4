Week 4

I will say that week 4 has been the most challenging of the whole course so far. I should say that it was as close to being
just as frustrating week one with the difference being that I expected to not understand a damn thing the first week.
I think TDD is beneficial for inexperienced people, like myself, because it is almost forcing you to do things step-by-step.
I know my main frustration is not with the process itself, but with my lack of being able to write the most basic code without 
second-guessing myself. That second-guessing leads to doubt and then ultimately to feeling defeated. I know I shouldn't
expect my progress to be any better than it is now, in fact I should feel atleast a little bit proud of my progress but I
just feel like it might not "click" in my head like I hoped it would.

I've had a bad weekend so my mood might be contributing to my negativity right now, so I'll stop and come back later with a 
more positive and genuine entry.

Sorry Future me
