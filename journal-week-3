Week 3
The todosMVC assignment was much easier the second time around(todosMVCv2). I still had a hard time with the edit functionality
but, everything else, as far as creating the db and the rest of the setup goes was not too bad at all.

I still need to bridge the gap of figuring out how everything relates to each other in the routes and controllers files.
definitely not nearly as confident as I would like to be up to this point in the course.

The weekend project was easier than the todosMVCv2 in that I am now pretty confident in getting everything up and running
to the point up until i had to associate the comments to particular posts. Im still not sure if i needed to just step back
and review it at a later date because it's starting to get more confusing the longer I stare at the same few files.

With that said, I know I've learned a lot but I'm not sure exactly what I've learned. I havent mastered anything but atleast
I can start to understand the code that I read. I definitely can't freehand any of it with any degree of confidence but
I can do a little bit with some sort of reference or example to loosely follow or use as a guide.
